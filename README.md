Bot for Windows messenger

Quackbot is a bot that responds to user messages. Specifically the word GRE would screen scrape a random 'word' its meaning and a sentence using that word and reply back to the user.

This was coded around the time GRE fever hits every aspiring MS/PhD applicant (~2003).

Backing up whatever nostalgic stuff I can scavenge off of my rotting disks.
